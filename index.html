                <p>Santa’s worse half is a hairy, devil-like creature called Krampus. Legend has it that while Santa brings toys to “nice” children,
Krampus’ job is to punish kids on the “naughty” list. Mostly he just frightens the children with his beastly looks, but it’s said
that he throws particularly bad children into his sack, or chains them up in his basket and carts them off to Hell. People in Austria
and neighboring countries often dress up as Krampus in early December and wander the streets to scare children.</p>

                <p>Guatemalans get fired up for Christmas. Literally. December 6 marks La Quema del Diablo (“the Burning of the Devil”), which is when families
in Guatemala set bonfires outside of their homes and burn effigies of Satan to expunge evil spirits, celebrating the victory of good over evil.
In the past, people would bring out all the trash from their houses and set it alight, and some still do. In the wake of environmental backlash,
however, many people stick to burning piñatas shaped like the Devil. This celebration is accompanied by traditional donuts and warm fruit punch,
and it signifies the start of the Christmas season.</p>

                <p>In the United States, we associate Christmas with ham or figgy pudding, but in Japan, it’s all about Kentucky Fried Chicken.
An estimated 3.5 million Japanese families eat fried chicken on Christmas Eve thanks to a marketing stunt by KFC in the 1970s
called Kurisumasu ni wa Kentakkii (“Kentucky for Christmas”). Christians make up a very small percentage of the Japanese population,
so this campaign made up for a lack of Christmas holiday traditions. The KFC Christmas Meal is so popular, many customers pre-order
their dinners — which include fried chicken, cake and champagne — months in advance.</p>
